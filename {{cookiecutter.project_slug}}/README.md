# Baking Cookies

After baking tasty cookies, you want to put them in a Cookie Jar and show them the world.
This is a Kit for deploying your application to AWS by using the [CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html).

If you're done baking, you can simply run the `bake.sh`.

```bash
# Make it executable first
chmod +x bake.sh
./bake.sh
```
